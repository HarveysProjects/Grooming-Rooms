<h3>Prices from Â£150*</h3>
<br/>
Sometimes your home or your rental property needs a really thorough clean to remove the inevitable build-ups of dust and dirt.
<br/><br/>
Maybe you haven't had a chance for a good clean for some time; maybe you are moving house or have new tenants moving in.
<br/><br/>
Whatever your reason for a blitz clean, our friendly team of cleaning professionals are experts at spring cleaning your home, making it wonderfully fresh and clean.
<br/><br/>
Similar to our regular cleaning packages, all of your surfaces are dusted thoroughly (high and low) and the floors are vacuumed and mopped throughout your home. In your bathroom/s we clean your bath, sink, shower, toilet/s, windowsills, tiles and floor. In your kitchen we clean the work surfaces, floors, oven tops, sinks and windowsills.
<br/><br/>
