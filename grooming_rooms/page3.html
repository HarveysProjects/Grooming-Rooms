House Cleaning Services from Grooming Rooms
<br/><br/>
Your home will be cleaned by our friendly team of Grooming Rooms cleaners on a day of your choice, using our own high quality, specialist cleaning products and equipment.
<br/><br/>
We provide a free fully-insured secure key-holding service so if you can't be there our maids can still fulfill your clean for you. A range of cleaning options is available to suit your requirements. This could be a one-off clean, spring clean or a regular cleaning service with a frequency that you choose, be it weekly, bi-weekly or monthly. 
<br/><br/>
We also provide a range of additional services including bed changing, oven cleaning and carpet cleaning services.

Customer satisfaction is highly important to us, so we a pay great attention to detail. If you have specific requirements such as particular areas or items in your home that need special attention (or any areas you don't want cleaned for some reason), our cleaning staff will honour your requests.

You'll always have the same team of two cleaning professionals each clean, who will ensure your house is beautifully cleaned, top to bottom.
<br/><br/>
All of your surfaces are dusted thoroughly (high and low) and the floors are vacuumed with Dyson vacuum cleaners which have high dust removal, and the ability to capture particles down to 0.5 microns (the only vacuum cleaners approved by both the British Allergy Foundation.). Our team pull out major furniture pieces such as sofas, to ensure a full clean throughout.
<br/><br/>
We also use vapour steam mops to clean, sanitise and deodorise hardwood, ceramic and laminate floors in one simple operation using dry steam at temperatures of 200o which quickly removes dirt, stains and grease, and kills dust mites, mould, germs, spores and bacteria without the use of chemicals.
<br/><br/>
In your bathroom/s we clean your bath, sink, shower, toilet/s, windowsills, tiles and floor. In your kitchen we clean the work surfaces, floors, oven tops, sinks and windowsills and buff all chrome and silver finish items so they are sparkling. 100% of limescale is removed throughout.
<br/><br/>
What's more, as we clean your house we move all appliances (as appropriate) to do a thorough clean of all the surfaces leaving them dust free. We even empty your bins, sanitise them and put in fresh bin liners - ready for your return home.
<br/><br/>
<h3>Bed changing service</h3>
<br/>
Our team are happy to change beds on a daily, weekly or bi-weekly basis - or as and when required to suit your needs. Bed linen will be removed, mattresses vacuumed, and clean linen replaced - ready and waiting for your arrival back home.
<br/><br/>
<h3>Oven cleaning</h3>
<br/>
Does your oven need a really good clean? Why have a sparkling kitchen when the inside of your oven is dirty? Our oven cleaning service leaves your oven brilliantly clean.
<br/><br/>
<h3>Carpet cleaning</h3>
